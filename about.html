                    It all started around 2010, was only around 5 at this point but yeah sky blue has been in my blood for a while. it was kinda around the time i started to speak crazily enough as well as my first steps into school. life could have turned out very different after all and i have no regrets on where my loyalties would lie.

                    6-1. agueroooooooooooooooooo! overall, one of my favourite seasons....it was very much action packed and intriguing. the feeling of beating your rivals to your first ever newly formed league title is a high that will never ever be topped...especially when it's on goal difference.

                    school, tennis, scrabble, wrestling (for a little bit)...all took over my life at that point but by 2016 - i was back and here to stay...also commencing with the new era of man city. It also was coincidently the start of the ensuing pep era that is still going on today nearly 6 years later.
